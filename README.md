# bank_account_bot
 
I wrote this telegram bot for self-study. In this project, I wanted to practice with the Postgresql database, and with OOP. This bot has registration by phone number, you can also top up your balance, transfer money by phone number, change your nickname, view your transfer history, and the bot also sends a notification about the receipt of the transfer to your account. In this project, I also practiced a bunch of database tables. There are 4 tables, 3 of which are linked by the foreign key (user_id) of the user's telegram account. I also added data entry checks in this bot.
